# Agentic AI Design Principles

An open set of design principles for building trustworthy, high-quality agentic experiences at Cisco. Use these guidelines to review new AI features, design collaborative agents, and address the common fears security and operations teams have about automation.

## Intro: why these principles
For years, securing an enterprise or running a global network was hands-on—analysts combed alerts, tweaked rules, matched logs and flows, and pushed configs across time zones just to keep up. The first wave of AI swapped clicks for chats, but systems still waited for our prompts. Agentic security and networking is the leap: software that proactively scans, analyzes, acts, recovers, and defends so teams can focus on strategy—while humans stay in control. These principles are grounded in our own work and best-in-class references (including Outreach) to guide that shift.

## What’s inside
- `AgenticAI_Design_Principles.md` — super-principles, core principles, ways of working, and fear-to-principle mapping.
- Use cases — grounded in security/operations, but intentionally generalizable to other domains.

## How to use this repository
- **Design reviews:** Use the Super-Principles (Deliver Quality, Build Trust, Amplify Productivity) as top-level checkpoints; drill into the numbered core principles to validate flows, UX copy, and safeguards.
- **Vibe coding:** Keep `AgenticAI_Design_Principles.md` open alongside implementation; treat each principle as a requirements checklist (data quality, guardrails, transparency, orchestration, delegation briefs, accessibility, cost awareness).
- **Decision defense:** Map stakeholder concerns to the “What Security Professionals Fear” section to show how your design mitigates risk.
- **Roadmaps:** Stage your rollout with the “Phased Implementation Roadmap” and “Spectrum of AI Management” to set realistic maturity goals.
