# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for helping improve the AI Agent Design Principles. The goal is to keep the guidance clear, actionable, and grounded in real-world agent design.

## How to propose changes
- **Start with an issue:** Describe the problem, the principle you want to change, and why it improves trust, quality, or productivity.
- **Submit a PR:** Reference the issue, summarize the change, and call out any new examples or definitions you add.
- **Stay grounded:** Anchor edits in observable outcomes (safety, reliability, explainability, efficiency) and include examples whenever possible.

## Writing style
- Use concise, direct language; prefer bullets over long prose.
- Keep principles outcome-oriented (what “great looks like”).
- For fears/risks, pair each concern with the principles that mitigate it.
- Avoid product-specific jargon, keep it reusable across domains.

## Structure to follow
- Super-Principles → Core Principles → Ways of Working → Fear-to-Principle mapping.
- Each core principle should have: short description, why it matters, what great looks like, and an example.
- Examples should show data, decisions, guardrails, and human-in-the-loop touchpoints.

## Review expectations
- Reviews focus on clarity, correctness, and alignment with responsible AI practices.
- Be ready to provide source references (research, pilots, metrics) for material changes.
- Maintain ASCII formatting and consistent heading levels in Markdown.
